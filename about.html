    <p>Hi, I'm Iris Hernandez, a Graphic Design student at the University of Minnesota with a passion for creating thoughtful, visually engaging work. My design approach blends creativity with purpose. I'm drawn to projects that tell stories, connect communities, and make information feel approachable. I first fell in love with design through community work and cultural events in Minneapolis, where I discovered how visual communication can bring people together. Since then, I've built experience designing posters, digital materials, and branding projects using tools like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Figma. As a bicultural and bilingual designer, I'm inspired by the intersection of art, culture, and technology. I aim to create work that reflects inclusivity and connection. Whether I'm designing for print or digital, I focus on clarity, color, and meaning in every project.</p>
